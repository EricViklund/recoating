\begin{abstract}

    Despite having advantageous superconducting properties, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities still have practical challenges compared to Nb SRF cavities due to the brittle nature of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn. Performance degradation can occur when a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity experiences mechanical stresses such as during handling and tuning of the cavity. In this study, we present a potential treatment for SRF cavities that have experienced stress induced performance degradation that involves a recoating procedure. The degraded cavity is coated with a small amount of Sn using a single step vapor-diffusion methodology. Using this approach we can recover a significant portion of the lost performance of a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity.
