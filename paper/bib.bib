To recognize the physical processes behind the losses in the accelerator modules, it is required to address not only the observed improvements but also the degradation occurring after different surface treatments. Here, we report on microscopic and spectroscopic studies of several cutouts from an extremely well performing cavity, which showed a systematic degradation after modified surface treatments and annealing conditions. Our results suggest that an abundance of low-angle grain boundaries surrounding the small sized grains can be related to the local superconductivity breakdown at high accelerating field gradients. Losses due to grain boundary segregated carbides are discussed to being most dominant and to leading to an anomalous Q-degradation of the whole cavity starting at low fields.}",

Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements of O, N, and C show that this enhancement in RF surface conductivity is primarily associated with interstitial O alloying via dissolution and diffusion of the native oxide. We use a theory of oxide decomposition and O diffusion to quantify previously unknown parameters crucial in modeling this process. RF measurements of a vacuum heat-treated Nb superconducting radio frequency cavity confirm the minimized surface resistance (higher Q0) previously expected only from 800 °C diffusive alloying with N.}",

This effect is attributed to the lowering of the Mattis-Bardeen surface resistance with increasing accelerating field; however, the microscopic origin of this phenomenon is poorly understood. Meanwhile, an enhancement of the sensitivity to trapped magnetic field is typically observed for such cavities. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on these different components contributing to the total surface resistance as a function of different levels of dissolved nitrogen, in comparison with standard surface treatments for niobium resonators. Adding these results together, we are able to show which is the optimum surface treatment that maximizes the Q-factor of superconducting niobium resonators as a function of expected trapped magnetic field in the cavity walls. These results also provide insights on the physics behind the change in the field dependence of the Mattis-Bardeen surface resistance, and of the trapped magnetic vortex induced losses in superconducting niobium resonators.}",

    abstract = "{Many future particle accelerators require hundreds of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities operating with high duty factor. The large dynamic heat load of the cavities causes the cryogenic plant to make up a significant part of the overall cost of the facility. This contribution can be reduced by replacing standard niobium cavities with ones coated with a low-dissipation superconductor such as Nb3Sn. In this paper, we present results for single cell cavities coated with Nb3Sn at Cornell. Five coatings were carried out, showing that at 4.2 K, high Q0 out to medium fields was reproducible, resulting in an average quench field of 14 MV/m and an average 4.2 K Q0 at quench of 8 × 109. In each case, the peak surface magnetic field at quench was well above Hc1, showing that it is not a limiting field in these cavities. The coating with the best performance had a quench field of 17 MV/m, exceeding gradient requirements for state-of-the-art high duty factor SRF accelerators. It is also shown that—taking into account the thermodynamic efficiency of the cryogenic plant—the 4.2 K Q0 values obtained meet the AC power consumption requirements of state-of-the-art high duty factor accelerators, making this a proof-of-principle demonstration for Nb3Sn cavities in future applications.}",

Scanning transmission electron microscopy performed on cross sections of the sample's surface region shows an ∼2 μm thick Nb3Sn surface layer. The elemental composition map exhibits a Nb:Sn ratio of 3:1 and reveals the presence of buried sub-stoichiometric regions that have a ratio of 5:1. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments indicate a polycrystalline Nb3Sn film and confirm the presence of Nb rich regions that occupy about a third of the coating volume. These low Tc regions could play an important role in the dissipation mechanisms occurring during RF tests of Nb3Sn-coated Nb cavities and open the way for further improving a very promising alternative to pure Nb cavities for particle accelerators.}",

The composition of these alloys is such that a continuous layer of a thermodynamically stable oxide is formed through selective oxidation of one of the constituting elements. Then, the oxide layer forms a barrier between the environment and the underlying alloy. The alloys for high temperature applications can be divided into alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2), or chromia (Cr2O3) formers, such as stainless steels, superalloys (Reed 2006), and intermetallics (MX, where M is Ti, Fe, Co or Ni, and X denotes Al, Si, or Cr). These materials are successfully applied in for example gas turbine engines (aero, marine, and industrial), heating equipment and automotive converters etc. In this chapter, the focus will be on alumina forming alloys encountered as coating material for blades and vanes in gas turbine engines. However, the principles addressed also apply to the other mentioned classes of high temperature alloys.",
